This is chapter 1.

ALARM CLOCK BEEEBS!!

He wakes up quite early in the morning, and the very first think he does is to kiss his wife and says "GOOD MORNING".

He dreams of a nice cup of coffee. He goes to kitchen to make coffee. He checked the fridge and VALAAAAA his wife made his lunch ready!

He smiles and he is happy because he can study little bit more before he leave home.
