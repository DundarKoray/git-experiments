CHAPTER 3

He has been waiting for the tram already a little bit over 10 minutes.

He starts to think there is a problem because he never had to wait this long time before.

He was about to check the mobile app to see if there was any notice about the tram line.

He finds out that today trams are not working.

He now need to walk 1 km to the nearest bus stop, he is already cold because he has been waiting over 10 minutes and he did not put on enough clothes today.

Well he walks to the bus stop and he dreams about a hot sauna while he is shaking and his teeth are hitting each other.
